Description: This package contains a set of standard graphing and summary table 
    functions to help streamline the review and evaluation of HEC-RAS model 
    results during calibration. The package currently contains functions for 
    producing reports containing the following visualizations. Hydrographs - 
    Compare modeled versus observed values for both water surface elevation and 
    discharge by cross section and model scenario. Longitudinal Profile Graph - 
    Compare water surface elevation by river mile for multiple model scenarios. 
    Graphs can also contain additional annotations (i.e., gage locations, levee 
    elevations, bridge elevations, river features, and high water marks) helpful 
    for evaluating model results. Goodness of Fit Statistics Tables - A table 
    of goodness of fit statistics (i.e., R^2, RMSE, MAE) between modeled versus 
    observed values by cross section and model scenario.
