# `razviz` v0.0.1 (release date 6/22/2020)

* Created the `razviz` package.
* Began porting code from a series of rmarkdown documents used to create graphs and reports from a previous project to the `razviz` package to improve code reusability, code maintanence, portability, and enhancement.
* Porting the code from a set of rmarkdown documents required some refactoring and decisions about the `razviz` package interface. The decision was made at this point that `razviz` would focus on providing functions that create standard graphs, summary tables, and reports. Data wrangling should probably be handled by other packages to maintain the focus of this package.
